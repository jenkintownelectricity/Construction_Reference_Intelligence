# Construction_Reference_Intelligence

Construction_Reference_Intelligence is the immutable reference intelligence layer for the construction-domain kernel family and additionally serves as the construction-family architecture guidance, observation, and relay layer.

## Construction OS Core Architecture (FROZEN)

├── ValidKernel-Governance
└── Construction_Kernel
     ├── Construction_Atlas (formerly Construction_Atlas_UI)
     ├── Construction_Runtime

Flow: Construction_Atlas → Construction_Runtime → Construction_Application_OS

Infrastructure / Guidance Authorities:
  Construction_OS_Registry              → Construction OS topology authority
  ValidKernel_Registry                  → Global kernel lineage authority
  ValidKernelOS_VKBUS                   → Governed guidance / observation / relay layer
  Construction_Reference_Intelligence   ← YOU ARE HERE (Reference intelligence + construction guidance relay)
```

> **Architecture Status:** FROZEN
> **Construction_Atlas** (formerly Construction_Atlas_UI) is a spatial context truth layer — not a UI surface.
> **UI Authority:** Construction_Application_OS is the sole UI surface of Construction OS.

## Role 1: Reference Intelligence Layer

This repository owns **immutable, version-controlled construction-domain reference intelligence**:

- Failure patterns
- Success patterns
- Precedents
- Trends
- Evidence-linked observations
- Confidence evolution
- Interface-risk observations
- Climate/lifecycle/geometry-linked intelligence

## Role 2: Construction Architecture Guidance Relay

Construction_Reference_Intelligence also acts as the **construction-family guidance, observation, and relay layer**, analogous to ValidKernelOS_VKBUS for the construction domain.

### Guidance Relay Capabilities

CRI may:
- Derive intelligence from construction-domain truths
- Observe architecture context from Construction OS repos
- Relay architecture guidance to active construction systems
- Document observations to registry

CRI must NOT:
- Redefine doctrine
- Own canonical topology
- Mutate frozen authorities
- Replace registry authority

### Architecture Relay Relationship

```
UTK / ValidKernel authorities
  ↓
ValidKernelOS_VKBUS              ← governed guidance / observation / relay
  ↓
Construction core
  ↓
Construction_Reference_Intelligence  ← analogous construction-family relay
  ↓
Active construction systems
```

Neither relay layer replaces doctrine owners or registries.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Relationship |
|------------|-------------|
| **Construction-domain truths** | Derives intelligence from registered construction-domain truth kernels and their outputs |
| **Construction OS repos** | Observes architecture context from Construction OS repositories |

## What This Repo Does NOT Own

This repo does **not** own canonical kernel truth schemas. Those belong to the five sibling kernel repositories:

| Kernel | Owns |
|--------|------|
| Construction_Specification_Kernel | Specification truth |
| Construction_Assembly_Kernel | Assembly truth |
| Construction_Material_Kernel | Material truth |
| Construction_Chemistry_Kernel | Chemistry truth |
| Construction_Scope_Kernel | Scope truth |

## Family Architecture

This repo is the **intelligence layer** in a six-repo construction-kernel family. The five canonical truth kernels listed above produce and maintain domain truth. This repo aggregates, cross-references, and preserves reference intelligence derived from and linked to those truths.

Where registered, these repositories are tracked in **ValidKernel_Registry**, which governs kernel identity, versioning, and cross-repo validation.

## Initial Domain Focus

**CSI Division 07 -- Building Envelope Systems (Thermal and Moisture Protection)**

All initial intelligence artifacts, control-layer definitions, and interface-zone registries target Division 07 enclosure systems. The domain is framed as an enclosure control-layer system, not merely a product bucket.

## Drift Sentinel (Optional Capability)

Drift Sentinel is an observational and advisory architecture drift detection capability available to the guidance relay role.

### What Drift Sentinel Observes

- Registry topology mismatches
- Missing dependency edges
- Architecture wording contradictions
- Stale lineage references
- Boundary violations
- Rename-lineage loss detection

### Drift Sentinel Operation Rules

Drift Sentinel may only:
- Generate reports
- Open pull requests
- Propose fixes

Drift Sentinel may NOT:
- Directly modify repositories
- Bypass governance
- Alter frozen authorities

This capability is observational and advisory only.

## CRI Signal Contract v0.1

CRI produces structured intelligence signals for the Cognitive Bus via the `cri/` module.

### Signal Types

| Signal Type | Event Class | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `observation` | `Observation` | Non-authoritative intelligence observation derived from analysis |
| `proposal` | `Proposal` | Suggested action based on analysis, for downstream consideration |

### What CRI Signals ARE

- Non-authoritative hints, observations, and proposals
- Structured intelligence carrying lineage metadata
- Valid Cognitive Bus event envelopes (schema v0.1)
- Inputs for the Awareness Cache to compile into frozen awareness

### What CRI Signals ARE NOT

- **NOT truth claims** — CRI never asserts canonical truth
- **NOT ExternallyValidatedEvent** — CRI must never emit this event class
- **NOT direct Awareness Cache writes** — CRI emits to the bus only
- **NOT directives or commands** — signals are suggestions, not orders

### Module Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `cri/config.py` | Identity constants, schema version, allowed signal types |
| `cri/signal_contract.py` | Signal type definitions and validation rules |
| `cri/signal_mapper.py` | Maps CRI signal types to Cognitive Bus event classes |
| `cri/signal_envelope_builder.py` | Builds valid Cognitive Bus event envelopes |

## Governance

- Fail-closed posture
- Immutable history
- Standards-aware without copying standards text
